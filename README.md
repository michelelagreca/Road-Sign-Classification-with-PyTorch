# Road Sign Classification with PyTorch
The project presented is a Road Sign Classification task using Pytorch. It is the project inserted in the last chapter of my Bachelor Thesis.<br><br>
## Approach
The project will analyze a case of classificiation of road sign. The dataset used for this classification is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), composed by 39209 training images divided in 43 classes and 12631 test images. This dataset can be download from: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign.
